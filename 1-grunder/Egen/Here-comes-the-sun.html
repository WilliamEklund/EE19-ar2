  <h1>Here comes the sun</h1>
  <p> Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo, here comes the sun <br>
    And I say it's all right</p><br>
    <p>Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter<br>
      Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here</p><br>
      <p> Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo, here comes the sun<br>
        And I say it's all right</p><br>
        <p>Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces<br>
          Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here</p><br>
          <p>Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo, here comes the sun<br>
            And I say it's all right</p><br>
           <p>Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
              Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
              Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
              Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
              Sun, sun, sun, here it comes</p><br>
              <p>Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting<br>
                Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear</p><br>
                <p>Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo, here comes the sun<br>
                  And I say it's all right</p><br>
                  <p>Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo, here comes the sun<br>
                    It's all right<br>
                    It's all right<br>
                    </p><br>
