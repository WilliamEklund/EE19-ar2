      <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2020 will occur on Saturday, October <br>
        31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of <br>Samhain, when people would light bonfires and <br>
        wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory <br>III designated November 1 as a time to <br>
        honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated <br>
        some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All <br>Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over <br>
        time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like <br>trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive <br>
        gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats.</p>
