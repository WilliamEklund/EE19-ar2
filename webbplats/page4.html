<h1>Fun facts about halloween</h1>
<h2>1. The holiday goes back more than 2,000 years</h2>

<p>Halloween all started as a pre-Christian Celtic festival called Samhain (which means "summer's end") held around the first of November. It celebrated the final day of the harvest and the crossing of spirits over into the other world. People in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Northern France would ward off ghosts by lighting sacrificial bonfires, and, you guessed it, wearing costumes, according to History.com.</p>
<h2>2. Trick-or-treating has existed since medieval times</h2>

<p>Back then, it was known as "guising" in Scotland and Ireland. Young people dressed up in costumes and asked for food or money in exchange for songs, poems, or other "tricks." Today, the tradition has morphed into children to getting dressed up and asking for candy.</p>
<h2>3. Some Halloween rituals used to involve finding a husband</h2>

<p>During the 18th century, ladies would follow Halloween traditions that would "help" them find a romantic match. According to History.com, women would: Throw apple peels over their shoulder hoping to see their future husband’s initials, competitively bob for apples at parties because the winner would be the first to get married, and stand in a dark room with a candle in front of a mirror to look for their future husband’s face. Thankfully, those traditions have died out.</p>
