<p>Hey all, 2020 is going to be huge here. I'm releasing several LARGE courses the first one on Scrimba.com! -- So be sure to subscribe up for the ride!  ALSO -- If you are an absolute beginner to frontend development, expect to feel like you got hit by a truck after watching this video. But that's the purpose of a crash course, there's a LOT of info packed into a short amount of time. There's a reason why there are courses that are literally 10-20 hours long, on JUST HTML alone.</p>

      <p>Hey all, 2020 is going to be huge here. I'm releasing several LARGE courses the first one on Scrimba.com! -- So be sure to subscribe up for the ride!  ALSO -- If you are an absolute beginner to frontend development, expect to feel like you got hit by a truck after watching this video. But that's the purpose of a crash course, there's a LOT of info packed into a short amount of time. There's a reason why there are courses that are literally 10-20 hours long, on JUST HTML alone. But this course will really help you get a feel for what it's like to work as a frontend developer on a project you might encounter. Don't be discouraged if you still feel overwhelmed by the end of the course --  that's to be expected.  Keep on taking courses and tutorials though, and I guarantee you it will begin to click a little bit more each time!</p>
